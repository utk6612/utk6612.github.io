I am currently pursuing my M.S. degree in Computer Science from NYU, Courant School of Mathematical Sciences, and offer 3.5 years of professional experience in the software industry with a focus on enterprise-level web applications, single-page applications, and progressive-web applications.

Apart from my technical skills, I carry a good understanding of UI/UX and thrive on improving online products by understanding user behaviour.

# Skills
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Typescript, Python, SQL(Postgres), Elixir, C/C++, 
React.js, Redux-Thunk, Redux-Saga, node.js (basics), AB Testing, Unit Testing, PWA, Rest
APIs, Git, Lerna


Here are some of the industry level projects which I have worked on,

## Goibibo-MakeMyTrip

[Goibibo Hotels](https://goibibo.com/hotels/){:target="_blank"}

*   Developed search results and payments page of desktop web and progressive web app (PWA) for Goibibo Hotels, which caters to more than 25k users per day.

*   Won Go-Tripper of the Month Award in Marchâ€™2020.

*   Developed a web framework called Stencil which went beyond component-driven architecture to segregate business logic from UI in reusable libraries, reducing the man-hours for any future front-end developments (using Typescript, React.js, Redux and React Hooks).

*   Collaborated with the product team to work towards increasing the conversion rate by 12% from the Search Results Page ([SRP](https://goibibo.com/hotels/hotels-in-goa-ct/){:target="_blank"}) to Payments Page by leveraging the power of AB Testing.

*   Presented a prototype for solving the problem of price mismatch in SSR rendered cached pages which was implemented across different verticals increasing the conversion rate by 9% for organic traffic. [Link](https://goibibo.com/hotels/hotels-in-goa-ct/){:target="_blank"}

## CoWrks

*   Developed two customer facing products CoWrks and [Converge](https://converge.cowrks.com/){:target="_blank"} from scratch using React and Redux by adhering to component-driven architecture.

*   Developed custom middlewares using Javascript and Redux-Thunk for tracking user engagement which helped in reducing the customer acquisition cost of the company.

*   Optimised performance of web applications by introducing a dynamic architecture and reducing the bundle size by more than 50% using server-side and client-side code splitting.

## HED Experts - xcelertor
[xcelerator.ninja](https://xcelerator.ninja/){:target="_blank"}

*   Took ownership and developed end to end core features like login, sign-up, payment gateway integration, and a simple recommendation engine (using React.js, Redux, HTML, CSS, Elixir, Phoenix and Postgres).

*   Proposed a new UX based on analysis and data from Google Analytics, thereby developing a new student dashboard, which was one of the essential features of the product, increasing the user engagement by 25%.

## Publicis.Sapient

*   Developed an equity trading platform for portfolio managers, traders, and brokers of the stock market.
*   My performance at Sapient rewarded me with an honoured title of Client-focused delivery.

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
