Here are some of my works,

## Goibibo Hotels
[Goibibo Hotels](https://goibibo.com/hotels/)

◦ Developed search results and payments page of desktop web and progressive web app (PWA) for Goibibo Hotels, which caters to more than 25k users per day - Goibibo Hotels.

◦ Won Go-Tripper of the Month Award in March’2020.

◦ Developed a web framework called Stencil which went beyond component-driven architecture to segregate business logic from UI in reusable libraries, reducing the man-hours for any future front-end developments (using Typescript, React.js, Redux and React Hooks).

◦ Collaborated with the product team to work towards increasing the conversion rate by 12% from the Search Results Page (SRP) to Payments Page by leveraging the power of AB Testing. [SRP](https://goibibo.com/hotels/hotels-in-goa-ct/)

◦ Presented a prototype for solving the problem of price mismatch in SSR rendered cached pages which was implemented across different verticals increasing the conversion rate by 9% for organic traffic. [Link](https://goibibo.com/hotels/hotels-in-goa-ct/)

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
